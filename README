# Personal Linux Kernel Error Tracking Repository

Welcome to my Personal Linux Kernel Error Tracking Repository! This repository is created to help me track and learn from errors encountered while working with the Linux kernel. By keeping a record of the errors I encounter and the solutions I find, I can enhance my understanding of the kernel and develop troubleshooting skills.

## Introduction

The Personal Linux Kernel Error Tracking Repository is designed to be my personal logbook for documenting the errors I encounter while working with the Linux kernel. It serves as a private space for me to reflect on my learning journey, understand and analyze the errors, and experiment with potential solutions.

## Recording Errors

When recording errors in my Linux Kernel Error Tracking Repository, I follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new Markdown (.md) file for each error encountered. For example, I can create a file called `device-driver-error.md` to document errors related to device drivers.

2. Open the Markdown file and describe the error in detail. I include any relevant error messages, stack traces, and steps to reproduce the error. Being specific and thorough helps me analyze the issue effectively.

3. If I find a solution or workaround for the error, I document it in the Markdown file. I include the steps I took to resolve the error, any code changes made, or any external resources I referred to. This documentation helps me consolidate my knowledge and reference it in the future.

4. Additionally, I can add any additional notes or observations related to the error that may be helpful for future reference or further exploration.

## Contributing

As this repository is intended for personal use, I do not actively seek contributions from others. However, I encourage anyone interested in learning about the Linux kernel to create their own error tracking repository and adapt this README template for their use.
